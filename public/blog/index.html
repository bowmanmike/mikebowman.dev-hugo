      <p class="text-slate-700">In an office in a city there lived a programmer. Sitting at his desk, (or standing, thanks to his adjustable desk), noice-cancelling headphones in place, typing away on his fancy keyboard with RGB backlights, happily immersed in Neovim. Err, wait. That&rsquo;s not right. Happily immersed in Visual Studio Code. Ahh, not quite. Happily immersed in Neovim. Dang. Doesn&rsquo;t feel right. Ok, last try. Unhappily immersed in whichever text editor he&rsquo;d happened to decide on for that week.

      <p class="text-slate-700">Deploying new code to production can be nerve-wracking. Things can break, unexpected behaviours can show up, all kinds of things can go sideways. It’s extremely important to be able to quickly revert changes, in the case that things go wrong unexpectedly. There are a bunch of different ways to approach this, but here I’ll be talking about Feature Flags.

When I was a kid, my siblings and I needed to find ways to entertain ourselves on long car rides. We thought it was fun to &ldquo;secretly plan&rdquo; to ask my parents, in unison, and in that particular sing-song way, &ldquo;Are we there yet?&rdquo;. Of course, we rarely were, and we knew that. And sure enough, the answer was always no. (More specifically, the answer was usually an interval of time measured in episodes of Bill Nye, the Science Guy, which somehow became the standard unit of measurement for long car rides in our family.) </p>

Nobody has a favourite data-interchange format? Nonsense! Everyone has one. Mine is JSON. Heard of it? Yeah, I thought so.
It&rsquo;s everywhere in the web world. I&rsquo;m not going to go into the details of what JSON is in this post, or what it stands for, or where it comes from, but if you&rsquo;re interested in that information, check out www.json.org. What I want to talk about here is some tricks to handling large amounts of JSON in a sane, speedy fashion. Because nobody likes crashing their text editor trying to open a 400mb JSON file holding 85,000 records with upwards of 20 fields each, because they&rsquo;re trying to find out the lowest value of one particular field. Yeah, definitely did that to myself at least once. It took an embarrassingly long time until I realized that there must be a better way, but once I found it, hoooo boy. Things improved, let me tell ya.

      <p class="text-slate-700">Ok, so here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s up. Github is a website where you can manage git repositories. Git is software that allows you to track changes to your code, and is super helpful for people working together on a project. Git and github are separate things, but most people use them together. It&rsquo;s called Version Control, which is a term I&rsquo;d never heard before, and there&rsquo;s options other than git (SVN and Mercurial, I think they&rsquo;re called). Git seems to be the most widely used though, at least in my experience.

We had our last day of class on the 11th of March, and we presented our final projects to the world at large (or part of it, anyways.) So now we&rsquo;re set loose on the world as mostly-fully-formed junior developers. Maybe not the most glamourous title, but you gotta start somewhere.

First, the excuses. We&rsquo;ve been working on a fairly substantial rails project this past week. Called Crowdfunder, it&rsquo;s a clone of Kickstarter. We got into groups to tackle it, because it really was a substantial assignment. After two late nights at the office, things were going well on the project. Which is exactly when a friendly flu virus decided it&rsquo;d be a great time to lodge itself in my respiratory tract. So I spent Thursday basically in bed the entire day. Yesterday was a bit better, but I stayed home from school again. Today I&rsquo;m substantially improved, but it might be a pretty long, drawn-out return to full normalcy.

First off, and probably most obviously: I&rsquo;ve changed platforms! I&rsquo;m not blogging on Medium any more, but rather on my very own personal domain and website. Last weekend I bought bowmanmike.com kinda on a whim, but domains aren&rsquo;t that expensive, and it seems like a good career move to have my own domain name. mikebowman.com is unfortunately taken by a real-estate agent from Texas, but he didn&rsquo;t think about the inversion, so HAH! Take that, Mike Bowman. I thought about going for bikemowman.com, but this seemed more professional. Turns out, buying domain names is a pretty painless process, and not super expensive. Unless, that is, you&rsquo;re looking at buying a super-trendy website that ends in .io. bikemowman.io was going for like $45 a year. I snagged bowmanmike.com for around $15 for the year, which seemed like a good deal.

      <p class="text-slate-700">So this week’s been a bit of a change of pace. We’ve shifted gears from Ruby and Rails, and have been learning Javascript. Javascript, for those who are unfamiliar, is one of the most widely used programming languages in the world (according to these guys, or these guys). It’s currently the only language that runs in ever web browser. This means that you–yes, YOU, dear reader, have access to Javascript in all it’s glory. Just try it out for a second here. If you’re using Google Chrome as your browser (which everyone in the world does, right?), hold down the Command and Option keys, and press “J”. For the Windows folks among us, CTRL + SHIFT + J is the equivalent. Something like this should appear on the side or bottom of your browser.

      <p class="text-slate-700">Rails is magic. There. I said it. And I’m learning how to use it. I had a bit of a breakthrough this week. As I may have mentioned previously, Rails is smart. It knows stuff that it really seems to have no right to know. But it’s also surprisingly intuitive. If you know what you want to do, all you have to do is type it out. In semi-plain English. Once you work out the normal syntax quirks (underscores and colons and the like), everything falls into place. Want to put a link somewhere? link_to. Where should the link go? The new user page? Easy enough. link_to “New User”, new_user_path. Done. Need to create a form to create a new user? form_for @user. Honestly, it’s that easy.
