      <description>&lt;p&gt;In an office in a city there lived a programmer. Sitting at his desk, (or&#xA;standing, thanks to his adjustable desk), noice-cancelling headphones in place,&#xA;typing away on his fancy keyboard with RGB backlights, happily immersed in&#xA;Neovim. Err, wait. That&amp;rsquo;s not right. Happily immersed in Visual Studio Code.&#xA;Ahh, not quite. Happily immersed in Neovim. Dang. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel right. Ok, last&#xA;try. Unhappily immersed in whichever text editor he&amp;rsquo;d happened to decide on for&#xA;that week.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Simple Feature Flags in Ruby</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Deploying new code to production can be nerve-wracking. Things can break,&#xA;unexpected behaviours can show up, all kinds of things can go sideways. It’s&#xA;extremely important to be able to quickly revert changes, in the case that&#xA;things go wrong unexpectedly. There are a bunch of different ways to approach&#xA;this, but here I’ll be talking about Feature Flags.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt; There is some preamble here before we get to the code snippets. If&#xA;you&amp;rsquo;d like to skip directly to the full code, &lt;a href=&#34;#full-code&#34;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;, or&#xA;scroll to the bottom!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Are We There Yet?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Are we there yet?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid, my siblings and I needed to find ways to entertain ourselves&#xA;on long car rides. We thought it was fun to &amp;ldquo;secretly plan&amp;rdquo; to ask my parents,&#xA;in unison, and in that particular sing-song way, &amp;ldquo;Are we there yet?&amp;rdquo;. Of course,&#xA;we rarely were, and we knew that. And sure enough, the answer was always no.&#xA;(More specifically, the answer was usually an interval of time measured in&#xA;episodes of Bill Nye, the Science Guy, which somehow became the standard unit of&#xA;measurement for long car rides in our family.) &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s talk about blogs. This one, in particular, and its evolution over the&#xA;years. After all, this site wasn&amp;rsquo;t built in a day, and neither was Rome. That&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;the expression, right?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This post will be in two parts. First, I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about the history of my&#xA;personal site, in its various incarnations, including this one. After, I&amp;rsquo;ll get&#xA;a bit technical, and get into the nitty gritty of how this new site works. If&#xA;that&amp;rsquo;s not your thing, my apologies, but feel free to just skip it!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>JSON: Fun for Everyone!</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/json-fun-for-everyone/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Friends! Settle in, I&amp;rsquo;ve got a good one for you today. I want to talk to you all&#xA;about my favourite data-interchange format! What&amp;rsquo;s that? Nobody has a favourite&#xA;data-interchange format? Nonsense!  Everyone has one. Mine is&#xA;JSON. Heard of it? Yeah, I thought so.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s everywhere in the web world. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to go into the details of what&#xA;JSON is in this post, or what it stands for, or where it comes from, but if&#xA;you&amp;rsquo;re interested in that information, check out&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.json.org&#34;&gt;www.json.org&lt;/a&gt;. What I want to talk about here is some&#xA;tricks to handling large amounts of JSON in a sane, speedy fashion. Because&#xA;nobody likes crashing their text editor trying to open a 400mb JSON file holding&#xA;85,000 records with upwards of 20 fields each, because they&amp;rsquo;re trying to find&#xA;out the lowest value of one particular field. Yeah, definitely did that to&#xA;myself at least once. It took an embarrassingly long time until I realized that&#xA;there must be a better way, but once I found it, hoooo boy. Things improved, let&#xA;me tell ya.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>HTTPS For everyone!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quick announcement! As of today, my personal site and this blog are both&#xA;HTTPS-enabled! Secure web traffic for everyone!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;rsquo;t take too long to set up, and was pretty straightforward. This site is&#xA;hosted on a $5 Digital Ocean droplet, which is a super-simple and affordable&#xA;hosting system. I followed&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-nginx-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-16-04&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;guide. The Digital Ocean tutorials are generally great, even if you&amp;rsquo;re not using&#xA;DO for your hosting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I don&amp;rsquo;t really have anything else to say, I was just excited that&#xA;everything worked!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well well well, here we are. In the words of a song my friend wrote for our band&#xA;in high school, &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s been so long, but now we&amp;rsquo;re back.&amp;rdquo; Lyrical genius, I say.&#xA;Anyways, it&amp;rsquo;s been quite a while since I posted, but I thought I might try and&#xA;resurrect this blog a little with some slightly more technical content. I&amp;rsquo;ve&#xA;been programming pretty much every day for over a year now, and I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve&#xA;done some kinda cool things. Lets dive in!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello! I&amp;rsquo;m still here! Never fear, dear reader, I&amp;rsquo;d never abandon you. I&amp;rsquo;ve been&#xA;meaning to do this post for a little while, so here we go.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a month and a day since the demo night at Bitmaker where we got to&#xA;show off &lt;a href=&#34;https://chortal.herokuapp.com&#34;&gt;chortal&lt;/a&gt; to the world at large. It&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;one of those things where it feels like it was ages ago but also like,&#xA;yesterday. So what have I been doing with myself?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Intro to Git</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ok, so here&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s up. Github is a website where you can manage git&#xA;repositories. Git is software that allows you to track changes to your code, and&#xA;is super helpful for people working together on a project. Git and github are&#xA;separate things, but most people use them together. It&amp;rsquo;s called Version Control,&#xA;which is a term I&amp;rsquo;d never heard before, and there&amp;rsquo;s options other than git (SVN&#xA;and Mercurial, I think they&amp;rsquo;re called). Git seems to be the most widely used&#xA;though, at least in my experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Alright. Let&amp;rsquo;s see if I can remember how to write. It&amp;rsquo;s been a few weeks since&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve typed anything that&amp;rsquo;s not code, so I might be a bit rusty. Apologies in&#xA;advance, to those it may offend. Things are winding down here at Bitmaker. Well,&#xA;they are for me and my cohort, the affectionately-titled &lt;em&gt;TEAM GORT&lt;/em&gt;. We had our&#xA;last day of class on the 11th of March, and we presented our final projects to&#xA;the world at large (or part of it, anyways.) So now we&amp;rsquo;re set loose on the world&#xA;as mostly-fully-formed junior developers. Maybe not the most glamourous title,&#xA;but you gotta start somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear reader, it&amp;rsquo;s been too long. Fear not, I&amp;rsquo;ve not forgotten you. I don&amp;rsquo;t have&#xA;much time to fully explain myself right now, because things are just a little&#xA;bit busy these days (actually that&amp;rsquo;s totally a lie. Things are crazy right now).&#xA;We&amp;rsquo;re deep in the midst of working on our final project (codenamed rmmts), an&#xA;app to allow roommates to keep track of chores and finances and stuff. It&amp;rsquo;s a&#xA;fun project, and it&amp;rsquo;s coming together pretty well thus far (knocking on &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;the wood).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is a bit later than I&amp;rsquo;d hope it&amp;rsquo;d be, but I&amp;rsquo;ve got excuses! Legitimate&#xA;ones! And lots of interesting things to talk about too, so, in the immortal&#xA;words of Samuel L. Jackson in Jurassic Park, &amp;ldquo;Hold on to your butts.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, the excuses. We&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a fairly substantial rails project&#xA;this past week. Called &lt;em&gt;Crowdfunder&lt;/em&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s a clone of&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://kickstarter.com&#34;&gt;Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt;. We got into groups to tackle it, because&#xA;it really was a substantial assignment. After two late nights at the office,&#xA;things were going well on the project. Which is exactly when a friendly flu&#xA;virus decided it&amp;rsquo;d be a great time to lodge itself in my respiratory tract. So I&#xA;spent Thursday basically in bed the entire day. Yesterday was a bit better, but&#xA;I stayed home from school again. Today I&amp;rsquo;m substantially improved, but it might&#xA;be a pretty long, drawn-out return to full normalcy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Got some fun stuff coming up this week, so hold on to your hats folks, we&amp;rsquo;re&#xA;going in!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First off, and probably most obviously: I&amp;rsquo;ve changed platforms! I&amp;rsquo;m not blogging&#xA;on Medium any more, but rather on my very own personal domain and website. Last&#xA;weekend I bought bowmanmike.com kinda on a whim, but domains aren&amp;rsquo;t that&#xA;expensive, and it seems like a good career move to have my own domain name.&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mikebowman.com&#34;&gt;mikebowman.com&lt;/a&gt; is unfortunately taken by a&#xA;real-estate agent from Texas, but he didn&amp;rsquo;t think about the inversion, so HAH!&#xA;Take that, Mike Bowman. I thought about going for bikemowman.com, but this&#xA;seemed more professional. Turns out, buying domain names is a pretty painless&#xA;process, and not super expensive. Unless, that is, you&amp;rsquo;re looking at buying a&#xA;super-trendy website that ends in &lt;em&gt;.io&lt;/em&gt;. bikemowman.io was going for like $45 a&#xA;year. I snagged bowmanmike.com for around $15 for the year, which seemed like a&#xA;good deal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So this week’s been a bit of a change of pace. We’ve shifted gears from Ruby and&#xA;Rails, and have been learning &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.javascript.com&#34;&gt;Javascript&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;Javascript, for those who are unfamiliar, is one of the most widely used&#xA;programming languages in the world (according to&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.newrelic.com/2015/07/07/popular-programming-languages/&#34;&gt;these guys&lt;/a&gt;,&#xA;or&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html&#34;&gt;these guys&lt;/a&gt;).&#xA;It’s currently the only language that runs in ever web browser. This means that&#xA;you–yes, YOU, dear reader, have access to Javascript in all it’s glory. Just try&#xA;it out for a second here. If you’re using Google Chrome as your browser (which&#xA;everyone in the world does, right?), hold down the &lt;em&gt;Command&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Option&lt;/em&gt; keys,&#xA;and press “J”. For the Windows folks among us, &lt;em&gt;CTRL&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;SHIFT&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;J&lt;/em&gt; is the&#xA;equivalent. Something like this should appear on the side or bottom of your&#xA;browser.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rails is magic. There. I said it. And I’m learning how to use it. I had a bit of&#xA;a breakthrough this week. As I may have mentioned previously, Rails is smart. It&#xA;&lt;em&gt;knows&lt;/em&gt; stuff that it really seems to have no right to know. But it’s also&#xA;surprisingly intuitive. If you know what you want to do, all you have to do is&#xA;type it out. In semi-plain English. Once you work out the normal syntax quirks&#xA;(underscores and colons and the like), everything falls into place. Want to put&#xA;a link somewhere? &lt;em&gt;link_to&lt;/em&gt;. Where should the link go? The new user page? Easy&#xA;enough. &lt;em&gt;link_to “New User”, new_user_path&lt;/em&gt;. Done. Need to create a form to&#xA;create a new user? &lt;em&gt;form_for @user&lt;/em&gt;. Honestly, it’s that easy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Things progress fast at Bitmaker. Like, crazy fast. Have I mentioned that&#xA;before? Well it’s still true. It’s barely been three weeks, and I’ve gone from&#xA;struggling to figure out the basics of Ruby, to struggling to figure out why my&#xA;gosh darn (super simple) app won’t work online. Yes, I’ve officially put my&#xA;first app online. It’s called Photogur (totally a copy of imgur, if only in&#xA;basic functionality), and it kinda works. This time last night, it worked&#xA;great.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;And thus ends week two at Bitmaker. Another week of knowledge and information&#xA;endlessly being thrown at us, like a child throwing spaghetti at the wall  (Not sure that’s real imagery, but I’m into it). The past week&#xA;was largely spent wrestling our previously mentioned command-line address book&#xA;program into a fully-fledged, database-backed, web app.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;From this..&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;./crm-cli-screenshot.png&#34; alt=&#34;Command Line&#xA;CRM&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;To this.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;./crm-web-screenshot.png&#34; alt=&#34;Web CRM&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the beginning…. There was a blog. Well, really, there wasn’t. It’s only just&#xA;now that there’s a blog. But now there is. I’ve made a blog for myself. I don’t&#xA;think I’ve ever had one before, and I never really envisioned this being&#xA;something that I’d do. But I figure it’s worthwhile to keep a bit of a record&#xA;about what’s going on at the moment. Maybe I’ll want to read it in the future?&#xA;Maybe you (if you’re actually reading this) will read it and find it interesting&#xA;or funny or depressing or some other adjective. Who knows. But that’s half the&#xA;fun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
