      <p class="text-slate-700 mt-2">In an office in a city there lived a programmer. Sitting at his desk, (or standing, thanks to his adjustable desk), noice-cancelling headphones in place, typing away on his fancy keyboard with RGB backlights, happily immersed in Neovim. Err, wait. That&rsquo;s not right. Happily immersed in Visual Studio Code. Ahh, not quite. Happily immersed in Neovim. Dang. Doesn&rsquo;t feel right. Ok, last try. Unhappily immersed in whichever text editor he&rsquo;d happened to decide on for that week.

      <p class="text-slate-700 mt-2">Deploying new code to production can be nerve-wracking. Things can break, unexpected behaviours can show up, all kinds of things can go sideways. It’s extremely important to be able to quickly revert changes, in the case that things go wrong unexpectedly. There are a bunch of different ways to approach this, but here I’ll be talking about Feature Flags.
NOTE There is some preamble here before we get to the code snippets. If you&rsquo;d like to skip directly to the full code, click here, or scroll to the bottom!

      <p class="text-slate-700 mt-2">Are we there yet?
When I was a kid, my siblings and I needed to find ways to entertain ourselves on long car rides. We thought it was fun to &ldquo;secretly plan&rdquo; to ask my parents, in unison, and in that particular sing-song way, &ldquo;Are we there yet?&rdquo;. Of course, we rarely were, and we knew that. And sure enough, the answer was always no. (More specifically, the answer was usually an interval of time measured in episodes of Bill Nye, the Science Guy, which somehow became the standard unit of measurement for long car rides in our family.) </p>

      <p class="text-slate-700 mt-2">So let&rsquo;s talk about blogs. This one, in particular, and its evolution over the years. After all, this site wasn&rsquo;t built in a day, and neither was Rome. That&rsquo;s the expression, right?
This post will be in two parts. First, I&rsquo;ll talk about the history of my personal site, in its various incarnations, including this one. After, I&rsquo;ll get a bit technical, and get into the nitty gritty of how this new site works. If that&rsquo;s not your thing, my apologies, but feel free to just skip it!
